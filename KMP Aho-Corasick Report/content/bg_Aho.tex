\subsection{History}
The Aho-Corasick algorithm was developed by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick in 1975. It is a multi-pattern string-searching algorithm that operates based on the Trie data structure, augmented with a failure function to enable efficient identification of multiple pattern occurrences within a given text. By constructing a finite-state automaton, the algorithm is capable of detecting multiple patterns concurrently in a single pass over the input text.

One of the primary advantages of the Aho-Corasick algorithm is its ability to search for multiple patterns simultaneously, eliminating the need for separate executions as required by algorithms such as KMP or Boyer-Moore. It achieves a time complexity of $O(n+m+z)$, where $n$ is the length of the input text, $m$ is the total length of all patterns, and $z$ is the number of pattern matches found. Additionally, the algorithm does not require redundant character comparisons, as the failure function enables efficient transitions upon mismatches. The Aho-Corasick algorithm finds extensive applications in network security, natural language processing, and computational biology. Due to its capability of handling large-scale multi-pattern searches, it significantly reduces processing time and resource consumption.

\subsection{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network security and malware detection: Deployed in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to identify attack signatures embedded within network traffic. Implemented in antivirus software to detect malware patterns within system files and memory.
    \item Text processing and keyword searching: Efficiently searches for multiple keywords simultaneously, making it ideal for content filtering in document processing, social media platforms, and email monitoring systems.
    \item Computational biology (bioinformatics): Utilized in DNA sequence analysis to locate multiple genetic markers or protein sequences within large genomic datasets, facilitating research in genetics and medicine.
    \item Spell checking and word suggestions: Applied in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance spell checking and autocomplete functionalities, improving text input efficiency in word processing applications.
